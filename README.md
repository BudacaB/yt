# Code for YouTube Videos

Here you can find the source code and notes for the videos uploaded to my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/BogdanBudaca).

<br>

## Installation

```
Please make sure to use the appropiate tools as needed per case:
    - A compiler for C for the C exercises (I use GCC)
    - For Java / Kotlin / Spring a JDK is needed
    - Node is needed for JavaScript 
    - Angular needs Node, NPM and the Angular CLI
    - Some exercises might require Docker
```

## Usage

```
This is also per case, the videos and their descriptions can also be useful.
```
